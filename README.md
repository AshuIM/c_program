// Car Rental System


The program allows users to create an account, rent vehicles and return vehicles
and calculates price by recording time elapsed between rent and return.

One second in real life is converted as one day in the program but this value can
be changed as shown in the globalvariables section.

This program was coded, debugged and executed using VISUAL STUDIO 2019 community version
